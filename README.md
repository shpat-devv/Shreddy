# Shreddy

A full-featured social media platform for skaters. Shreddy helps you find skate spots, connect with fellow skaters, and share your latest tricksâ€”all in a Snapchat-like experience. Built with Django (backend) and React (frontend), Shreddy is designed for and by the skating community, with a mobile app coming soon.
